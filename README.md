# Final Project! (Among Huskies)
For this project, we built a game where users compete in 2 teams to pet a husky, competing for its adoration! The game requires 4 players, divided into teams of 2. The game terminates when both players from a single team touch the husky sprite of the opposing team. During the game, users may chat through the terminal as well. The team that pets the husky wins!

- [Testing notice] When you test the client dub project, please note that the server must be on for the tests to run, as the client depends upon connection to the server. 
- [known bug] If the husky is fully collided into by a player, as opposed to just tapped, it will like you so much that it will follow you and you will not be able to complete the race for its adoration.

# Team spread sheet 

- Your team members and project manager will be provided in class. 
- Your project manager will be your first point of contact for various project deliverables and questions. Though you may continue to attend office hours with whoever you like, your project manager will be your primary contact.

## Team Logistics

- Work with your team to ensure everyone has a way to work on this codebase with a common set of tools.
- Everyone should make code contributions to the repository (i.e. everyone should have some commits in the commit history -- even if you pair program, that means you need to switch who is in control!)
- See the project timeline
- Note: In semesters where I have a 'token system' for late days, **you cannot use any tokens** for the final project.
